# Agentic AI Code Analyzer - System Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the Agentic AI Code Analyzer system, which consists of a FastAPI backend and a VS Code extension frontend.

## System Overview

The Agentic AI Code Analyzer is a real-time code analysis system that provides intelligent suggestions and error detection as users write code. The system consists of two main components:

1. **FastAPI Backend**: A Python-based API that performs code analysis using static analysis tools, sandboxed execution, and AI models
2. **VS Code Extension**: A frontend that integrates with VS Code to provide real-time feedback as users write code

The system is designed to be modular, with the backend handling the complex analysis tasks and the frontend providing a user-friendly interface.

## Component Architecture

### FastAPI Backend

The backend is built using FastAPI, a modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python. It provides two main endpoints:

- `/analyze`: Analyzes a single code snippet
- `/analyze_repo`: Analyzes an entire GitHub repository

The backend performs analysis using multiple techniques:

1. **Language Detection**: Uses a Hugging Face model to identify the programming language
2. **Static Analysis**: For Python code, runs flake8 and mypy to identify potential issues
3. **Runtime Execution**: Runs the code in a Docker sandbox to catch runtime errors
4. **AI-Powered Suggestions**: Uses a Hugging Face model to generate intelligent suggestions for improvement

The backend is containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.

### VS Code Extension

The VS Code extension is built using the VS Code Extension API and provides:

1. **Real-time Analysis**: Monitors code changes and sends code to the backend for analysis
2. **Diagnostic Display**: Shows issues and suggestions directly in the editor
3. **Command Integration**: Provides commands for manual analysis of files and repositories
4. **Configuration Options**: Allows users to customize the extension's behavior

The extension communicates with the backend via HTTP requests and displays the results using VS Code's Diagnostics API.

## Data Flow

1. **Code Changes**: User writes or modifies code in VS Code
2. **Analysis Request**: VS Code extension sends the code to the FastAPI backend
3. **Multi-level Analysis**:
   - Language detection
   - Static analysis (if applicable)
   - Runtime execution in a sandboxed environment
   - AI-powered analysis for suggestions
4. **Response**: Backend returns analysis results, including issues and suggestions
5. **Display**: VS Code extension displays the results as diagnostics in the editor

For repository analysis, the process is similar but operates on multiple files:

1. **Repository URL**: User provides a GitHub repository URL
2. **Repository Cloning**: Backend clones the repository
3. **File Discovery**: Backend identifies relevant code files
4. **Batch Analysis**: Each file is analyzed as described above
5. **Aggregated Results**: Results are compiled and returned to the extension
6. **Display**: VS Code extension shows results in an output channel

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment

1. **Backend**: Run locally using `python app.py` (starts on localhost:8000)
2. **Frontend**: Run in VS Code's Extension Development Host

### Production Environment

1. **Backend**:
   - Deploy as a Docker container
   - Can be hosted on any cloud platform (AWS, Azure, GCP)
   - Configure with environment variables for API keys and settings
   
2. **Frontend**:
   - Package as a VSIX file using the build script
   - Distribute through the VS Code Marketplace or via direct installation

## Security Considerations

1. **Code Isolation**: All code execution happens in isolated Docker containers to prevent security issues
2. **API Key Protection**: Hugging Face API keys are stored in environment variables
3. **Rate Limiting**: The backend can be configured with rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. **CORS Protection**: The API has CORS middleware to control access

## Extension Points

The system is designed to be extensible:

1. **Language Support**: New languages can be added by updating the supported extensions and Docker configurations
2. **Analysis Tools**: Additional static analysis tools can be integrated
3. **AI Models**: Different AI models can be used for language detection and suggestions
4. **VS Code Features**: The extension can be enhanced with additional VS Code integrations

## Getting Started

### Setting Up the Backend

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up environment variables (e.g., in a `.env` file)
4. Start the server: `python app.py`

### Setting Up the VS Code Extension

1. Navigate to the `vscode-extension` directory
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Package the extension: `node build.js`
4. Install the extension in VS Code

## Troubleshooting

### Common Backend Issues

- **Docker not running**: Ensure Docker is installed and running
- **API key issues**: Verify the Hugging Face API key is correctly set
- **Port conflicts**: Check if port 8000 is already in use

### Common Extension Issues

- **Connection errors**: Ensure the backend is running and accessible
- **Analysis timeout**: Large files or repositories may take longer to analyze
- **Display issues**: VS Code's Diagnostics API may have limitations for certain file types

## Future Enhancements

1. **More Languages**: Add support for additional programming languages
2. **Enhanced AI Models**: Integrate more advanced AI models for better suggestions
3. **PR Integration**: Automatically create pull requests with suggested fixes
4. **Team Collaboration**: Add features for team-based code review and analysis
5. **Performance Optimization**: Improve analysis speed and efficiency

This architecture provides a solid foundation for a modern, AI-powered code analysis system that integrates seamlessly with developers' workflows through VS Code.
